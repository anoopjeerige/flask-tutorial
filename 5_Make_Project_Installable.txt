Make Project Installable
------------------------
- To create a distributable file and install in another environment
- One can import the application irrespective of the location you run it from.
- Can manage project's dependencies just like other packages.
- Test tools can isolate your test environment from development environment

Important Note
--------------
The making a project installable and below steps should be done in the beginning.

A) Describe the project
- The setup.py file describes the project and the files that belong to it.
- packages=find_packages(), where packages tells python what package directories
  and their python files to include.
  find_packages() finds these directories automatically
- include_package_data=True is set to include other files like static and template directories
- MANIFEST.in tell python about the other files

B) Install the project
- pip install -e .
  This tells pip to find setup.py in the current directory and install it in a development mode
